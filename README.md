jPanels is a lightweight mosaic plugin that is built on jQuery. It takes 13 photos and displays them as an interactive mosaic. The plugin randomly chooses a maximum of 4 photos to "feature" by displaying it larger than the other photos. This option can be turned off by commenting out a few lines of javascript. It is highly customizable to the user's preference. This is a work in progress, and updates will be pushed routinely.
